# Eat-Da-Burger

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a web application where I can log burgers with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

### How Eat-Da-Burger Works

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
